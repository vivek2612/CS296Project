Our simulation on running make or make install produces two executables

1) RubeGoldbergMachine which contains the actual simulation and
2) RubeGoldbergMachinePlots which is used for generating plots 

along with the documentation. The difference between the two is that make installs the 
files in the current folder while make install installs the files in the INSTALLPATH folder.
